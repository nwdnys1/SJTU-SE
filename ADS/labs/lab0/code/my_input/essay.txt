 Flexible Sex Ratios: Exploring the Impact on
 Lamprey and Ecosystem Stability
 Summary
 Sea lampreys can adjust their sex ratio based on external environments. This adaptive sex ratio
 variation, along with lampreys’ position as both parasites and food sources, plays a special role in
 different ecosystems. To derive the effect of variable sex ratios on lamprey and ecosystems, here are
 our methods.
 In Problem 1, we build the initial model: Lamprey’s Sex Ratio-Based Ecosystem Model, namely
 the LSE Model. Based on Logistic Model and Lotka-Volterra Predation Model, we construct a
 basic ecosystem containing lampreys, humans, and lampreys’ prey. By changing lampreys’ initial prey
 amounts, we prove the spectacular capability of lampreys to adapt the ecosystem by changing their sex
 ratio.
 In Problem 2, we compare the performance of lampreys with their competitors from 2 different
 dimensions. Wecomparetheperformance of lampreys with one of their competitors in both segregated
 andmutualenvironments. Thechangeinsexratioofferstheextraordinaryabilityforlampreystosurvive
 in extreme conditions, but lampreys are not competitive enough when food is abundant, as the adaptive
 sex ratio variation restricts its growth rate.
 In Problem 3, to analyze the stability of ecosystems, we construct an ecosystem network based
 on our LSE Model. In our Optimized-LSE(OLSE) model, 8 different species share the same living
 environment. Thus, inspired by the Shannon-Wiener Index, we provide the Ecosystem Diversity
 Index (EDI) based onspecies richness, food chain length, and average species abundance in the OLSE
 model. We use simulated data from OLSE and obtained EDI based on linear regression. Then, we
 present the Ecosystem Stability Index (ESI) according to the pattern of EDI. The result shows that
 the further the lamprey’s sex ratio deviates from 0.56, the stronger the ecosystem’s stability is.
 In Problem 4, to discuss and analyze whether lamprey’s adaptive sex ratio mode provides advan
tages to other species in the ecosystem, we introduce three types of parasites into our previous OLSE
 model. The three types of parasites count on lampreys to survive, The third edition- LPE model
 is launched due to the inspiration of infectious viruses. By putting a sight on the parasite and fish
 community, we find that the change in sex ratio can also benefit other species, such as enhancing the
 diversity and complexity of the parasite community. It is worth thinking that the change in lamprey’s
 sex ratio also benefits the surrounding ecosystem.
 Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the models we established, which proves the
 stability and reliability of the models, and shows the rationality of parameter selection. Our models
 also have many advantages, including being concise yet highlighting the problem, having a rigorous
 logical derivation process for the model parameters, etc. More details are discussed deeply at the end
 of the paper.

 1 Introduction
 1.1 Background
 Thesex ratio is important for understanding species’ survival strategies and adaptive mechanisms.
 While most species have a sex ratio close to 1:1 at birth, exceptions exist. The sea lamprey is a
 species that adjusts its sex ratio to different environmental conditions. In food-poor environments, the
 proportion of males increases significantly, while in food-rich environments, the proportion of males
 decreases relatively. Sea lampreys have garnered significant attention from scientists due to not only
 their adaptive sex ratio variation but also their crucial role in various ecosystems. For instance, sea
 lampreys may be considered parasites in some lakes, while they serve as a food source for humans
 in other regions. Therefore, it is crucial to study the impact of the sea lampreys’ adaptive sex ratio
 variation on ecosystems.
 1.2 Restatement of the Problem
 Considering the background information identified in the problem statement, we need to focus on
 the impact of sex ratios on the ecosystem and finish the following tasks:
 1) Task 1 Construct a mathematical model to help analyze the impact of lampreys’ variable sex
 ratio on the larger ecosystem where other species exist.
 2) Task 2 Explain the advantages and disadvantages of sea lamprey’s adaptive sex ratio variation
 to its population.
 3) Task 3 Consider changes in the sex ratio of sea lampreys and how these changes affect the
 stability of the ecosystem.
 4) Task 4 Discuss and analyze whether this adaptive sex ratio mode provides advantages to other
 species in the ecosystem, such as parasites.

 2 General Assumptions
 Through careful analysis, we make the following basic assumptions to simplify the problem.
 • Assumption 1: For how species affect each other, there is a direct interaction between predators
 and prey, i.e., the number of predators affects the mortality rate of prey.
 Justification: Researchershaveobservedthatpredatorabundanceoractivitylevelsinfluenceprey
 mortality rates. For example, when predator populations increase, there is often a corresponding
 increase in prey mortality due to predation.
 • Assumption 2:The survival and reproduction of predators in the ecosystem model depends on
 the amount of prey they take.
 Justification:The survival and reproduction of predators depend on the amount of prey they
 consume is justified by the principles of energy flow and trophic interactions in ecosystems.
 • Assumption 3: Lampreys do not differentiate between the sexes at the larval stage but rather go
 through a certain growth cycle to differentiate between male and female sexes at adulthood.
 Justification: According to related research[1], it was found that Lampreys’ sex could be labile
 until larvae reach 140 mm and capable of changing in 8–16 weeks. They will differentiate into
 different sexes based on different growth rates.
 • Assumption 4: The population of Lampreys does not change significantly discretely.
 Justification: Lampreys have a certain reproductive cycle and maturation period, which means
 they can’t reproduce all the time. Meanwhile, their mortality rate does not usually fluctuate
 extremely over a short period.

 4 Model1: Lamprey’s Sex Ratio-Based Ecosystem(LSE) Model
 4.1 Description of Larger Ecosystem
 Based on the background introduced, Lampreys feeds primarily by parasitizing other fish, while
 preying on plankton. At the same time, the population of lampreys reduces due to human fishing
 activities. To clearly describe the larger ecosystem, we consider in this ecosystem there are two main
 population, lampreys and their prey. To simulate the activities between lampreys, prey, and humans,
 we define the parameter p. To find out the relation between lamprey’s sex ratio and this ecosystem, we
 define the male sex ratio M and the female sex ratio F.
 4.1.1 Ecosystem Logistic and Lotka-Volterra Predating Model [2]
 Figure 2: Basic Ecosystem Based on Logistic and Lotka-Volterra Predating Model
 Considering in this ecosystem, the population density of lamprey L(t), the population density of
 lampreys’ prey H(t), and the ratio of male lampreys M(t) changes continuously over time. Due to
 environmental constraints, there is a theoretical limit to the fish population. We denote this limit as
 Hmax. First, we examine changes in the population of lampreys’ prey in the ecosystem. For now, we
 consider the most basic case: the growth without any environmental limitations. Under this situation,
 the population of lampreys’ prey should meet equation (1). α represents the natural growth rate of the
 lamprey’s prey.
 dH(t)
 dt =α·H(t)
 (1)
 However, from the Logistic growth model, we know the population of prey won’t keep growing.
 The equation should include the maximum population retardation factor (1 − H(t)
 Hmax
 ). So we correct
 equation (1) to equation (2).
 dH(t)
 dt =α·H(t)·(1− H(t)
 Hmax
 )
 (2)
 In this ecosystem, not only does the prey’s growth affect its population, but lampreys’ hunting
 reduces the population of prey as well. Considering the probability of lampreys hunting preys as ppre,
 we know the reduction of prey’s population due to lampreys’ hunting is ppre · H(t) · L(t). Hence, we
 further equation (2) to equation (3), which mainly represents the change in prey population.
 dH(t)
 dt =α·H(t)·(1− H(t)
 Hmax
 ) −ppre · H(t) · L(t)
 (3)
Team 2410115
 Page 6 of 25
 Next, we examine changes in the population of lampreys in the ecosystem. Based on the Lotka
Volterra model, the change in the lamprey’s population consists of three components. Since lampreys
 hunt prey, part of the growth of the lamprey’s population comes from the energy gained from digesting
 the prey. This part of the energy is used to reproduce new lampreys. We denote this increase as ∆Lpre.
 Besides, lampreys’ population decreases due to natural mortality and human harvesting, respectively
 ∆Ldea and ∆Lhum. Hence, the population of lampreys should meet equation (4).
 dL(t)
 dt =∆Lpre−∆Ldea−∆Lhum
 (4)
 Respectively, according to the law of conservation of energy, ∆Lpre equals to η·ppres·H(t)·L(t).
 We assume that the effect of natural death on population is linear, ∆Ldea equals to γ · L(t). Finally,
 ∆Lhum equals to phum · L(t) because we note that phum represents the probability of human fishing
 lampreys. Thus, we can convert equation (4) into equation (5).
 dL(t)
 dt =η·ppre ·H(t)·L(t)−γ ·L(t)−phum ·L(t)
 4.1.2 Lamprey’s Sex Ratios Analysis
 (5)
 For now, equations about changes in the population of lampreys and prey have been set. To
 introduce the sex ratio effect into our model, we consider 2 special characteristics of lampreys:
 1. Whenthefoodis adequate and the environment is stable, the male ratio of lamprey is still greater
 than its female ratio.
 2. As is shown in the research[5], when lamprey parents giving birth, they both die. So in the case
 of a high male ratio, the birth rate is lower due to the low female ratio.
 To match this trend in lamprey’s birth rates when its sex ratio changes[6], the increase ∆Lpre from
 hunting prey should include the sex ratio factor M(t)·(1−M(t)−c)
 (1−c
 2 )2
 . So wecorrect equation (5) to equation
 (6), which mainly represents the change of the lamprey’s population.

 dt = M(t)·(1−M(t)−c)
 (1−c
 2 
)2
 · η · ppre · H(t) · L(t) − γ · L(t) − phum · L(t)
 (6)
 Finally, to find out the change in male sex ratio M over time, we write down the equation (7)
 according to the definition of male sex ratio, which is the ratio of current male lampreys to total
 lampreys. The total male lampreys at the next moment are the total males at the current moment
 Lmale(t) plus the male lampreys newly differentiated from larvae ∆Ldif. Besides, we need to take male
 reduction due to natural mortality ∆Ldea into consideration.
 M(t+dt) = Lmale(t+dt)
 L(t +dt) = Lmale(t)+∆Ldif −∆Ldea
 L(t +dt)
 (7)
Team 2410115
 Page 7 of 25
 Respectively, we calculate the total males at the current moment Lmale(t) is M(t) · L(t). The
 newly-differentiated males ∆Ldif is c · P · L(t)dt. The reduction due to natural mortality ∆Ldea is
 d · M(t)· L(t)dt. We successfully obtain the following equation (8).
 M(t+dt) = M(t)·L(t)+c·P ·L(t)dt−γ ·M(t)·L(t)dt
 L(t +dt)
 (8)
 Here, we use the idea of approximate processing. Because we have assumed that in a short period,
 the population of Lampreys does not change significantly, we can let L(t + dt) = L(t) approximately.
 Hence, equation (9) is ready.
 dM(t)
 dt =M(t+dt)−M(t)
 dt
 =c·P −γ·M(t)
 (9)
 Nowwehavelearned how the sex ratio and the population of lampreys and their prey change over
 time. From equation (3), (6) and (9), a system of equations (10) that can represent the relationship
 between the three variables is shown as follows.

 To obtain the relationship between the sex ratio and populations of predator and prey species, we
 try to solve the parameters of the differential equations described above.
 First of all, we can analyze parameters from related ecological data[3]: natural growth rate of
 lamprey’s prey α, energy conversion rate of lampreys η, natural mortality of lampreys γ, the probability
 of human fishing lampreys phum. And we hypothesize Hmax to be 1000.
 It is evident from the analysis that When P = M(t), Equation (9) becomes biologically meaning
ful: the male ratio of the lamprey population should remain unchanged when the ratio of males at time
 t equals the ratio of individuals that are about to differentiate into males. Consequently, the left-hand
 side of the Equation 3 should be 0, which leads to c = γ.
 For the parameter P, the probability of lampreys differentiating into males, we get inspired by
 the Logistic function. The Logistic function is often used to feature changes in a biological system’s
 characteristics. We use the Logistic function to reveal the relation between P and the amount of food
 H(t)
 L(t) 
. As the basic Logistic function, P should meet the following equation (11). (A, B and U are
 parameters)

 4.3 Problem 1: Impact of Lampreys’ Variable Sex Ratio on Larger Ecosystem
 From the parameters and the equation we get in 4.1 and 4.2, we can generate the figure of H(t),
 L(t), and M(t) based on the ode45 method. We choose H(0) = 500 to represent the lampreys’ food
 in the environment being adequate. Our work is clearly shown in following Figure 3.
 (a) Lamprey Population Dynamics
 (b) Fish Prey Population Dynamics
 Figure 3: Dynamic Population of Lamprey and its Prey with Different Initial Size H0
 AsisshowninFigure3(a), thepopulationoflampreyandpreyfirstchangesincurveandeventually
 converges to a definite value. It demonstrates that lamprey can effectively adjust its population under
 the same initial sex ratio and population despite the different populations of prey in larger ecosystems.
 Finally, the population of both lamprey and prey reaches an optimized number. It is worth mentioning
 that the less the prey is initially, the more quickly the bottom of the curve appears.
 To find out how lampreys do this magic trick, we carefully observe the dynamic of lampreys’ sex
 ratio when the population of prey in a larger ecosystem is different. Changes in the ecosystem are
 continuous. As is shown in Figure 3(b), lampreys’ sex ratio first changes in the curve and eventually
 converges to a definite value of 0.56. It is worth mentioning that the more the prey are initially, the
 more quickly the top of the curve appears.
 Based onFigures 3(a) and 3(b), for problem 1, we conclude that under all circumstances, lampreys
 canalwaysadjusttheirsexratiotocontrolthepopulationintheecosystemtoanoptimizedfoodavailable
 situation. This mode guarantees lampreys havingthebest living environment andadequatefood. Under
 different initial external environments, the adjusting speed of this mode changes to effectively meet this
 need.

 4.4 Problem 2: Advantages and Disadvantages of Adaptive Sex Ratio
 For Problem 2, we want to explain the advantages and disadvantages of sea lamprey’s adaptive
 sex ratio variation to its population. Based on the Lotka-Volterra competitive theory, we introduce the
 lamprey’s competitor into the ecosystem improve our LSE model, and choose 2 different situations to
 demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the lamprey’s mode. We also adopt the method of
 controlling variables in our study.
 4.4.1 Situation 1: Lampreys and Competitors in Segregated Ecosystems
 Figure 4: Situation 1: Lampreys and Competitors in Segregated Ecosystems
 Consider lampreys and competitors living in segregated ecosystems with the same initial con
ditions, the only difference is their sex ratio changing mode. For normal competitors, we assume
 that their sex ratio is always fixed to a certain number, such as 1:1. Analogously, we can obtain the
 following ecological equation system (14) to demonstrate the ecosystem of the competitor. R means
 the population density of competitors. H expresses the population density of competitors’ prey.

 (14)
 Then, we put lamprey and its competitor into different ecosystems. They should have different
 results according to their sex ratio mode. We choose to change the initial population of the lamprey.
 The Effect of Sex Ratio Mode on Lampreys and its Competitor is shown in Table 3. The Dynamic
 Population of Lamprey and its Competitor is shown in Figure 5. As is illustrated in the table and Figure
 5 (b), the curve converges to 0 when L(0) = 400 for competitor, which means they are extinct. So, the
 adaptive sex ratio mode makes lamprey more likely to survive in the food-poverty ecosystem than its
 competitors.

 From our model, we know when the competitor’s sex ratio is fixed, the maximum capacity of
 competitor Rmax is 398. As a comparison, we change the initial sex ratio of lamprey. Table 4
 clearly shows that under different initial sex ratios, lampreys always outperform their competitors in
 the maximum population capacity.

tages to the population in avoiding lamprey becoming extinct and gives lamprey a larger population
 capacity.

 Finally, we can simulate the dynamic population of lamprey and its competitor in the same
 environment in Figure 7. As is shown in Figure 7(a), we choose the initial value L(0) = R(0) =
 100,M(0) = 0.6,whichmeansthefoodinthisecosystemisratherinsufficient. Inthiscase,lampreystill
 successfully outperforms its competitor in maintaining its population and surviving this competition.
 However, in Figure 7(b), the initial value L(0) = R(0) = 20,M(0) = 0.6 means the food is
 rather adequate in this ecosystem. But lamprey loses this competition against its competitor due to its
 adaptive sex ratio.
 (a) Population in Food Shortage Environment
 (b) Population in Food Adequate Environment
 Figure 7: Dynamic Population of Lamprey and its Competitor in the same Environment
 From our analysis, we can conclude that this sex ratio mode of lamprey enables them to survive
 the competition when there’s in shortage of food but extinct when the food is enough. Based on the
 conclusions under the 2 situations above, we can now answer Problem 2: the advantage of this sex ratio
 mode is that lampreys are harder to control when they fiercely invade another environment because
 they are more competitive in bad environments[4]. Meanwhile, the disadvantage is that lampreys can’t
 survive the long-term competition in a food-adequate environment.

 5.1 Optimization of the LSE model
 5.1.1 Introducing More Species
 Considering there are more species in this ecosystem, we have 3 levels of species. At the top
 of the pyramid, the only top predator D (a kind of animal but not human) hunting lampreys L and
 lampreys’ competitor R. In the middle of the pyramid, lampreys and lampreys’ competitor hunt 3 kinds
 of different fishes H1,H2,H3 as prey for their living. At the bottom of the pyramid, these 3 kinds of
 f
 ishes feed on the natural resources G and have a fixed natural growth rate and death rate. As is shown
 in Figure 8, this optimized ecosystem contains 8 different species.
 Figure 8: OLSE Ecosystem Pyramid
 Just like the equation system we have set in paragraph 4, we can also obtain the following equation
 systems (18), (19), (20). In equation system (18), the population of 3 kinds of prey should meet this
 relation. According to the pyramid, prey H1 and H3 feed on the same natural resource, so their natural
 growth shares the same constraints H1max = H3max. Prey H2 is both hunted by lamprey and lamprey’s
 competitor, so the factor changes to (L + R).

 Likewise, equation system (19) shows how the population of lamprey and its competitor change.
 Because there exist a higher level predator D, so the population decrease due to D, ∆DL = pDL ·L·D
 and ∆DR = pDL·R·D. pLR representstheprobability of top predator hunting lampreys and lamprey’s
 competitors.

 periodically in the end. Meanwhile, the population of H2,D keeps a linear growth at first and will
 eventually converge to a defined value. It means OLSE can effectively provide simulated data for our
 analysis of the stability of the ecosystem.

 5.2 Ecosystem Stability Evaluation
 Based on our optimized ecosystem model OLSE, we can get amounts of simulation data easily.
 Thus, in this part, we present the method to evaluate ecosystem stability. We first introduce the
 EcosystemDiversityIndex(EDI).Ecologicaldiversityiskeytothehealthandfunctionoftheecosystem.
 EDI reflects the diversity of species in the ecosystem. For further research, the Ecosystem Stability
 Index (ESI) is defined based on EDI. Ecosystem stability is the ability of an ecosystem to maintain its
 structure and function in the face of external disturbances and internal changes. ESI reflects the ability
 of ecosystems to maintain their structural and functional stability.
 5.2.1 Ecosystem Diversity Index (EDI)
 To make an overall evaluation of the diversity of the ecosystem, we have to collect enough
 information from our OLSE ecosystem. This previous research inspired us to set the EDI equation (21)
 and choose the three following impact factors. wi is their weight respectively:
 EDI =w1·µ+w2·λ+w3·φ
 (21)
 1. Species richness of the ecosystem µ: Species richness is an important concept in ecology,
 which refers to the number of different species in a given area. It is one of the basic indicators of
 biodiversity, reflecting the diversity of species within the region. In our EDI index, the species
 richness of the ecosystem is represented by an integer number µ.
 2. Food chain length of the ecosystem λ: Food chain length describes the number of steps in
 an ecosystem in which energy is transferred from producers to final consumers. Simply put,
 the length of a food chain is the number of trophic levels in the food chain, with each trophic
 level representing a link in this energy transfer process. In our EDI index, an integer number λ
 expresses this food chain length.
 3. Average species abundance in the ecosystem φ: Species abundance refers to the density of
 individuals of a particular species in an ecosystem. It reflects the prevalence or rarity of the
 species in the area. In our EDI index, we put the abundance of all species into consideration and
 get our average species abundance in the ecosystem.
 Basedontheenergybalancetheoryofecosystems[7],ahealthyandstableecosystemcanmaintain
 a state of relative energy equilibrium, where the input of energy (mainly solar energy) is roughly
 equal to the output of energy (mainly heat loss and productivity of organisms). According to
 the OLSE pyramid, equation (22) shows the average species abundance in the ecosystem, which
 considers the energy factor in the food chain.

 5.2.2 Linear Regression: Solve the Weight of EDI
 For now, we want to solve each weight in the EDI equation. From ecology, we can learn the
 Shannon-Wiener Index N is an important index used to quantify the diversity of biomes in ecology,
 providing a comprehensive measure of ecosystem diversity (in equation (23)), Xi represents the
 proportion of the number of species i in all the species). So we want our EDI index as close as possible
 to the Shannon-Wiener Index.

 Based on the OLSE model, we change the parameters to simulate the ecosystem under different
 situations. For each situation, we can accurately calculate the S-W Index. To improve the performance
 and reliability of the EDI index, we normalized the S-W Index as the EDI value for our reference. As
 is shown in Table 5, the OLSE model provides enough data for our EDI index (we choose 52 different
 situations in total). Finally, based on the linear regression approach, we solved for the values of the
 individual weights under our OLSE model as is shown in Table 6.

 Figure 10 (a) clearly shows that our final Predicted EDI (calculated on equation (21)) is very close
 to Reference EDI, which demonstrates its good performance. The R-squared value here is 0.9526. To
 further prove the accuracy of EDI, we make a Quantile-Quantile plot of residuals. As is illustrated in
 Figure 10 (b), the sample quantiles is close to the theoretical quantiles line, which prove the residuals
 follow a normal distribution and our EDI model is reasonable and accurate.

 5.2.3 Ecosystem Stability Index (ESI)
 Ecosystem stability is the key indicators of ecosystem health and sustainability. The ESI index
 allows us to quantify the stability of the environment in an ecosystem. An ecosystem with a high
 degree of stability is less vunlerable to external disturbance. According to National Ecological Status
 Specification[8], Ecosystem Stability Index (ESI) is defined as following Equation (24). V ar(EDIt)
 represent the EDI’s variance from initial moment to moment t. Ave(EDIt) express the EDI’s mean
 value from initial moment to moment t. The smaller the ESI is, the better the stability of the ecosystem
 owns.
 ESI = Var(EDIt)
 Ave(EDIt)
 (24)
 5.3 Problem 3: How Adaptive Sex Ratio Mode Affect the Ecosystem Stability
 Ultimately, we utilized the OLSE model to generate data on the changes in population numbers
 under different initial sex ratios and calculated the Ecosystem Diversity Index (EDI) and Ecosystem
 Stability Index (ESI) curves over time, as well as the relationship curve between ESI and sex ratio
 during the extrapolation process of the OLSE model.
 Figure 11(a) presents the trends of EDI and ESI in our OLSE model when the initial sex ratio
 M(0) = 0.6. It can be observed that with the passage of time, EDI gradually increases and stabilizes,
 indicating that the diversity and complexity of the ecosystem continuously grow during the natural
 evolutionary process and eventually stabilize as the ecosystem stabilizes; The ESI first increases and
 then decreases over time, suggesting that the ecosystem is relatively unstable in the initial stages of
 evolution, experiencing significant changes in function and diversity, but returns to stability in the final
 stages of evolution. Such changing trends align with our expectations for the evolutionary trajectory
 of a normal ecosystem.
Team 2410115

 (a) Time-EDI and Time-ESI Dynamics
 (b) Male Ratio-ESI Relationship
 Figure 11: Problem 3 Solving: Adaptive Sex Ratio Mode and the Ecosystem Stability Relationship
 Figure 11(b) shows how ecosystem stability evolves with changes in the sex ratio of lampreys
 during the ecosystem’s evolutionary process. Under different initial sex ratios, the Male Ratio-ESI
 relationship curves generally follow the same pattern, i.e., the ecosystem’s stability is relatively poor
 whenthe maleratio is close to 0.56, but as the male ratio deviates from 0.56, stability strengthens. This
 trend maybeduetotheabilityforlampreystoalteritssexratiodependingonresourceavailability; when
 the male ratio significantly deviates from 0.56, lampreys respond more sensitively to the environment,
 thereby more stably adapting to the ecosystem and indirectly leading to stronger overall ecosystem
 stability.
 Based on our OLSE model and the EDI/ESI evaluation, we can ultimately conclude that the
 lamprey’s ability to alter the sex ratio has a significant impact on ecosystem stability during the
 ecosystem’s evolutionary process, and the further the lamprey’s sex ratio deviates from 0.56, the
 stronger the ecosystem’s stability.
 6 Model3: Lamprey-Parasite Ecosystem(LPE) Model
 To discuss and analyze whether lamprey’s adaptive sex ratio mode provides advantages to other
 species in the ecosystem, we introduce three types of parasites into our previous OLSE ecosystem.
 They all parasitize on the lamprey and form a parasite community. We also choose to use the diversity
 and complexity of the parasite community to evaluate its advantages. Then, we analyze how this sex
 ratio mode affects the diversity of parasites based on Shannon-Wiener Index.
 6.1 Description of Parasites
 Considering that viruses parasitize on hosts just like parasites on lampreys, we get inspired by the
 Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. SIR is a classical infectious disease model for describing
 the dynamic transitions between susceptible, infected, and emigrating individuals[9]. However, in this
Team 2410115
 Page 20 of 25
 ecosystem, those lampreys that have recovered from parasites will not be immune to other parasites.
 For simplicity, we assume that one lamprey can only be infected by one kind of parasite. So we have
 to rewrite the basic SIR model (in formula (25)) into an SI model based on the OLSE ecosystem.
 l expresses the growth rate factor of the parasite. r refers to the rate of lampreys recovering from
 parasites.

 lampreys due to our assumption. And when there are 3 kinds of different parasites, lampreys consist of
 4 different partitions. SL represents those lampreys that are susceptible to any kind of parasites. We
 also provide ILi(i = 1,2,3) to represent the number of infectious lampreys respective to 3 different
 kinds of parasites. We also assume that there will only be one cause of death at one moment. From the
 basic SIR model (25), we add equation system (26) to our original OLSE model, which expresses the
 dynamic of these 4 kinds of lampreys. Besides, lampreys also die from the parasites with a probability
 of m.

 (b) Long-term Time-SW Index Dynamics
 Figure 12: Problem 4 Solving: Adaptive Sex Ratio Mode’s Advantages to Parasite Community
Team 2410115
 Page 21 of 25
 Figure 12 illustrates the results obtained from our new model regarding the diversity of parasite
 communities. Figure 12(a) displays the short-term trends in the Shannon index of parasite communities
 within two different ecosystems. The curve for ecosystems with variable sex ratios in the lamprey
 population is notably higher than that for ecosystems without lampreys. This suggests that, in the early
 stages of ecosystem evolution, the diversity and complexity of parasites are positively influenced by
 the presence of lampreys. Figure 12(b) presents the long-term trends in the Shannon index of parasite
 communities. It can be observed that, in ecosystems lacking species with variable sex ratios, the
 Shannon index of parasites gradually declines to zero, indicating its eventual extinction. In contrast,
 ecosystems with lampreys, despite experiencing significant drops in the Shannon index due to the
 extinction of certain parasites, ultimately stabilize at a certain value. This indicates a strong stabilizing
 effect of lampreys on the parasite within their ecosystems.
 Theresults generated by our OLSEmodelwithparasite communities suggest that the ability of sea
 lampreys to vary their sex ratios confers significant advantages on the parasite communities within their
 ecosystems. These advantages include an enhancement of diversity in the short term and a positive
 impact on the stable survival of parasites in the long term.
 Figure 13: Problem 4 Solving: Adaptive Sex Ratio Mode’s Advantages to Fish Community
 Figure 13 presents the results of applying the same approach to fish communities within an
 ecosystem. Similar to the analysis of parasite communities, the Shannon index of fish communities
 in an ecosystem with lampreys is significantly higher compared to one without lampreys. However,
 unlike parasites, all fish species can survive relatively stably regardless of the presence of lampreys,
 and their Shannon index gradually approaches stability.
 Based on the analysis of fish and parasite communities mentioned above, we can conclude that
 an ecosystem with variable sex ratios in the lamprey population does provide significant advantages
 for other species. For parasites and fish, lampreys enhance their diversity and complexity, while also
 enabling long-term stable survival. Considering our analysis of the third question, such results are
 in line with expectations: the ability of lampreys to vary sex ratios strengthens the adaptability and
 stability of the entire ecosystem, while also providing advantages for other species in terms of diversity
 and complexity.

 7 Sensitivity Analysis
 7.1 TheSensitivity Analysis of LSE Model
 To test the sensitivity of our model, we change the certain variable H(t) while other variables
 stay unchanged. We choose H(0) = 200, H(0) = 350, H(0) = 500,H(0) = 650,H(0) = 800 to
 respectively represent different food amount in different environments. Our work is clearly shown in
 Figure 14.

namics
 Figure 14: Sensitivity Analysis Of LSE Model
 As is shown in Figure 14(a), the population of both the lamprey and the prey begin to change in
 curve and finally merge to a definite value. It demonstrates that the lampreys can automatically adjust
 their population within a certain range when the number of prey changes dramatically. The slope drops
 or soars dramatically at the first stage and then decreases to 0 gradually. In Figure 14(b), the population
 of the preys also merge to a definite value in the end. It is also worth mentioning that the less the prey
 is initially, the more quickly it reaches the bottom of the curve.
 We also simulate the dynamic of lampreys’ sex ratio as the population of the prey varies. As
 is shown in Figure 14(c), lampreys’ sex ratio initially changes in the curve and eventually converges
 to a definite amount of 0.56. The smaller H(0) is, the bigger the slope is initially. Still, the slope
 soars dramatically in the first and finally drops to zero and the sex rate remains stable, following the
 requirement of the problem. It is also worth mentioning that the less the prey is initially, the more
 quickly it reaches the bottom of the curve.
 BasedonFigures3and4,wecanjumptotheconclusionthatourmodelisrobustwhenconsidering
 this parameter.
 7.2 TheSensitivity Analysis of Linear Regression
 Whensolving the weight of the EDI index, we use the method of Linear Regression.[10]Here, we
 will introduce the method of Data Perturbation.
 Data Perturbation involves making slight adjustments to the data. It can entail adding random
 noise to input features or making minor modifications to the response variables. It’s important to
Team 2410115
 Page 23 of 25
 ensure that the magnitude of perturbation is small enough so as not to completely alter the fundamental
 characteristics and distribution of the data. The model is retrained on the perturbed data, and the same
 performance metrics are recorded once again.
 WiththehelpofDataPerturbation,theperformancemetricsoftheoriginalmodelandtheperturbed
 model are compared to assess the sensitivity of the model to changes in the data. We will use Mean
 Square Area(MSE) to conduct sensitivity analysis.
 MSE = 1

 In equation 27, Yi refers to the real value, while the other one refers to the predicted value. If
 we use mean squared error (MSE) as a performance metric, we can calculate the percentage change in
 MSEofthe original model MSE1 and the perturbation model MSE2 to quantify sensitivity.
 According to our linear regression, the amount of MSE1 is 1.8671. We can compare the
 percentage change with the help of Table 7

 8 Strength and Weakness
 Strength
 • Simplicity : We summarize the complicated ecosystem into a relatively simple model, which is
 suitable for solving. Some unimportant factors are neglected to highlight what we want to focus
 on.
 • Stability: We conducted sensitivity analysis on the models using different parameters and data
 source, finding that the results have similar characteristics and comply with our expectations,
 fully verifying the stability of our models.
 • Rationality : Our models are adapted from the Logistic model, Lotka-Volterra model, and SIR
 model, withreasonableparametersthatarederivedfrompreciselogicandreasonableestimations.
 The resulting curve is also as expected and can be explained.
Team 2410115
 Page 24 of 25
 Weakness
 • We did not take other environmental factors into account, such as temperature and water flow
 rate. Research has shown that water flow rate does indeed have an impact on the sex ratio of
 lampreys[1]. This may require further expansion of the model to research these factors.
 • The relationship between birth rate and sex ratio may lack persuasiveness. The formula we
 established for birth rate is based on prior knowledge and some assumptions, requiring additional
 empirical data or previous research to demonstrate its reliability and rigor.
